He was hired by the rich and powerful lord of the county to stop the funny little man. Gerrard was known far and wide for his super smell and incredible speed. The funny little man was not without strengths of his own, though, he had grown up in these woods. He knew the ins, the outs, the ups and the downs.  He Could cover his tracks at a moment's notice. As he used his trusty mushroom finder, he made large sweeping steps as to make his path winding and confusing. Gerrard springing as fast as he could to find the funny little man. He knew it was his duty to keep the peace, or else all would be lost. As He grew nearer and nearer to the funny man, he could hear a digging noise.

The funny man held the mushroom in his mouth, and a bit down with the force of a thousand jaws. Reality warped, Gerrard screamed, and all was lost.
